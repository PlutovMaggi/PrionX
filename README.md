# PrionX
AI Algorithms for Structural Biology Project - Maggi Plutov
======
This repository contains all the results from our PrionX project:

Data Folder:

  - Original Data: Includes cath.fasta, disprot.fasta, and prion_db.csv, which were the starting datasets.
  - Output Files: Contains files generated during the project for easy access and loading later.
  - Report: A PDF file summarizing our findings and methodology.


Code: 

  - An IPython notebook file with the project code.

  For a more user-friendly view, our code is also available on Google Colab here:
  Google Colab Notebook

  The notebook includes the final code used for running the CNN models and analyzing results, along with some legacy code for sections not covered in the report.


Key Sections to Reproduce Our Results:

  - Imports, General Functions, and Drive Connection: Essential for setting up the environment.
  - CNN Analysis: This section contains several cells that execute the CNN models and present results, including confusion matrices and analyses of human and Arabidopsis data.


Additional Sections:
  - Prep Data: Used for preprocessing tasks to create files utilized in later analyses and includes frequency analyses not included in the main report.
  - Old CNN Runs (No Functions): This can be ignored as it contains disorganized legacy code used for earlier CNN attempts.
